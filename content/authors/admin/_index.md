Chelsea Piel is a music educator from central Texas. She will be graduating from Texas State University in May 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree in Music Studies and an All-Level Teaching Certification in the state of Texas. Chelsea began studying cello in 6th grade orchestra and decided to pursue music education early on in high school. Upon entry to the Texas State School of Music, Chelsea sought out roles that allowed her to practice the skills necessary to be successful in the music classroom. As a lead teacher and private lesson instructor for the Texas State String Project, she taught beginner cello and full string orchestra classes. She was also selected to fulfill the role of Orchestra Manager for the Texas State Symphony Orchestra where she organized venue arrangements and music from vendors for each concert and managed the orchestra library. In the spring of 2021 she completed her intership within the Round Rock Independent School District where she taught both high school orchestra and elementary music. Chelsea looks forward to putting her skills to work when she starts her career this fall. In her classroom, she wishes to create a community of trust between herself, her students, and her peers.
